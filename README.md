Thank you for attention.
The Pomodor Counter is an educational project developed by me, and it's pretty functional.

It's very intuitive:
    To start the counter, press the Start Button. To stop and reset, Reset button.
    The pomodoro technique is very useful to involve your effectiveness while working or studying, and it works in four 
    working cycles forming a bigger cycle. 
        The first three cycles will be composed by 25 minutes work sessions and 5 minutes break times to stretch your
        legs, arms and relax your brain. The last cycle will have the same time working, but a 20 minutes pause. Then is
        possible to chat with colleagues, friends and relatives.
        After the pause, the clock will be restarted, and the
        hole cycle will run again.

Enjoy!
